Aisera,ChatGPT for customer support,"The “GPT” in “ChatGPT” stands for Generative Pre-training Transformer, a family of Large Language Models (LLMs) that serve as a foundation for ChatGPT and similar tools. Essentially, these models function as artificial neural networks and AI models trained on very large sets of natural language samples.With the help of Natural Language Processing (NLP), a branch of computer science focused on allowing computers to “understand” and use natural conversations in ways similar to humans, these neural networks can approximate and effectively analyze multiple languages to generate automated responses without much human intervention.In other words, ChatGPT is a specific artificial intelligence (AI) application designed to understand linguistic prompts and provide seemingly intelligent responses based on what it has learned in its language training."
